  title = {On achievable accuracy for range-finder localization},
  booktitle = icra,
  year = {2007},
  address = {Rome, Italy},
  abstract = {The covariance of every unbiased estimator is bounded by the Cramer-Rao
	lower bound, which is the inverse of Fisher's information matrix.
	This paper shows that, for the case of localization with range-finders,
	Fisher's matrix is a function of the expected readings and of the
	orientation of the environment's surfaces at the sensed points. The
	matrix also offers a mathematically sound way to characterize under-
	constrained situations as those for which it is singular: in those
	cases the kernel describes the direction of maximum uncertainty.
	This paper also introduces a simple model of unstructured environments
	for which the Cramer-Rao bound is a function of two statistics of
	the shape of the environment: the average radius and a measure of
	the irregularity of the surfaces. Although this model is not valid
	for all environments, it allows for some interesting qualitative
	considerations. As an experimental validation, this paper reports
	simulations comparing the bound with the actual performance of the
	ICP (Iterative Closest/Corresponding Point) algorithm. Finally, it
	is discussed the difficulty in extending these results to find a
	lower bound for accuracy in scan matching and SLAM.},

	We seek hypotheses that can justify a separate implementation of

	control problem to path-planning in the extended space of poses x
	covariances; the transitions between states are modeled through the
	use of the Fisher information matrix. In this framework, we consider
	two problems: minimizing the execution time, and minimizing the final
	covariance, with an upper bound on the execution time. Two correct
	and complete algorithms are presented. The first is the direct extension
	of classical graph-search algorithms in the extended space. The second
	one is a back-projection algorithm: uncertainty constraints are propagated

  booktitle = icra,

  abstract = { We present a new algorithm for solving the global localization problem
	called Frozen-Time Smoother (FTS). Time is `frozen', in the sense
	that the belief always refers to the same time instant, instead of
	following a moving target, like Monte Carlo Localization does. This
	algorithm works in the case in which global localization is formulated
	as a smoothing problem, and a precise estimate of the incremental
	motion of the robot is usually available. These assumptions correspond
	to the case when global localization is used to solve the loop closing
	problem in SLAM. We compare FTS to two Monte Carlo methods designed
	with the same assumptions. The experiments suggest that a naive implementation
	of the FTS is more efficient than an extremely optimized equivalent
	Monte Carlo solution. Moreover, the FTS has an intrinsic laziness:
	it does not need frequent updates (scans can be integrated once every
	many meters) and it can process data in arbitrary order. The source
