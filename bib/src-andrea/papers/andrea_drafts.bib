  title = {Motion planning in observations space with learned diffeomorphism

  institution = {California Institute of Technology},
  year = {2012},
  number = {CaltechCDSTR:2012.004},
  abstract = { We consider the problem of planning motions in observations space,
	based on learned models of the dynamics that associate to each action
	a diffeomorphism of the obser- vations domain. For an arbitrary set
	of diffeomorphisms, this problem must be formulated as a generic
	search problem. We adapt established algorithms of the graph search
	family. In this scenario, node expansion is very costly, as each
	node in the graph is associated to an uncertain diffeomorphism and
	corresponding predicted observations. We describe several improvements
	that ameliorate performance: the introduction of better image similarities
	to use as heuristics; a method to reduce the number of expanded nodes
	by preliminarily identifying redundant plans; and a method to pre-compute
	composite actions that make the search efficient in all directions.},
