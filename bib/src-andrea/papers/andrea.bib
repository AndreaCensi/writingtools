	work, the problem of "bootstrapping" is studied in the context of

	consists in analyzing such simple sensorimotor cascades and proposing
	models of varying complexity that can be learned from data. The second

	of assumptions", as a particular form of invariance that the bootstrapping
	agent must satisfy, and proposes some invariance-based design techniques.

  abstract = {The covariance of every unbiased estimator is bounded by the Cramer-Rao
	lower bound, which is the inverse of Fisher's information matrix.
	This paper shows that, for the case of localization with range-finders,
	Fisher's matrix is a function of the expected readings and of the
	orientation of the environment's surfaces at the sensed points. The
	matrix also offers a mathematically sound way to characterize under-
	constrained situations as those for which it is singular: in those

	This paper also introduces a simple model of unstructured environments
	for which the Cramer-Rao bound is a function of two statistics of
	the shape of the environment: the average radius and a measure of
	the irregularity of the surfaces. Although this model is not valid
	for all environments, it allows for some interesting qualitative
	considerations. As an experimental validation, this paper reports
	simulations comparing the bound with the actual performance of the

	field with demonstrated successes in various domains. While much
	progress has been made in the development of computationally efficient
	and consistent mapping schemes, it is still murky, at best, on how

	will also enable the proliferation and acceptance of such technologies
