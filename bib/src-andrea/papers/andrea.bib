	to which it is connected, and use it to achieve useful tasks, without

	work, the problem of "bootstrapping" is studied in the context of
	the Vehicles universe, which is an idealization of simple mobile

	consists in analyzing such simple sensorimotor cascades and proposing
	models of varying complexity that can be learned from data. The second
	thread regards how to properly formalize the notions of "absence
	of assumptions", as a particular form of invariance that the bootstrapping
	agent must satisfy, and proposes some invariance-based design techniques.

  abstract = {The covariance of every unbiased estimator is bounded by the Cramer-Rao
	lower bound, which is the inverse of Fisher's information matrix.
	This paper shows that, for the case of localization with range-finders,
	Fisher's matrix is a function of the expected readings and of the
	orientation of the environment's surfaces at the sensed points. The
	matrix also offers a mathematically sound way to characterize under-
	constrained situations as those for which it is singular: in those
	cases the kernel describes the direction of maximum uncertainty.
	This paper also introduces a simple model of unstructured environments
	for which the Cramer-Rao bound is a function of two statistics of
	the shape of the environment: the average radius and a measure of
	the irregularity of the surfaces. Although this model is not valid
	for all environments, it allows for some interesting qualitative
	considerations. As an experimental validation, this paper reports
	simulations comparing the bound with the actual performance of the

    Pose optimization is what is used in SLAM to optimize the map
    after pose-pose and pose-features correspondences have been established. 
    The variables in this problem are poses living
    on the nodes of a graph, and measurements are relative measurements
    along the graph edges. The
    problem is hard because orientations live on a manifold
    with nontrivial topology, which makes the problem
    nonlinear, nonconvex, and with multiple minima.
    [Luca][luca] and I try to solve the subproblem of orientation estimation. 
    We find a way to convert
    the problem to an unconstrained optimization problem on integers.
    This makes it possible to solve the problem globally 
    and return all likely guesses for the orientation.

abstract = {For the first time in history, automated vehicles (AVs) are being deployed in populated environments. This unprecedented transformation of our everyday lives demands a significant undertaking: endowing complex autonomous systems with ethically acceptable behavior. We outline how one prominent, ethically relevant component of AVs—driving behavior—is inextricably linked to stakeholders in the technical, regulatory, and social spheres of the field. Whereas humans are presumed (rightly or wrongly) to have the “common sense” to behave ethically in new driving situations beyond a standard driving test, AVs do not (and probably should not) enjoy this presumption. We examine, at a high level, how to test the common sense of an AV. We start by reviewing discussions of “driverless dilemmas,” adaptions of the traditional “trolley dilemmas” of philosophy that have sparked discussion on AV ethics but have limited use to the technical and legal spheres. Then, we explain how to substantially change the premises and features of these dilemmas (while preserving their behavioral diagnostic spirit) in order to lay the foundations for a more practical and relevant framework that tests driving common sense as an integral part of road rules testing.}}

ABSTRACT = {In recent years the increasing needs of reducing the costs of car development expressed by the automotive market have determined a rapid development of virtual driver prototyping tools that aims at reproducing vehicle behaviors. Nevertheless, these advanced tools are still not designed to exploit the entire vehicle dynamics potential, preferring to assure the minimum requirements in the worst possible operating conditions instead. Furthermore, their calibration is typically performed in a pre-defined strict range of operating conditions, established by specific regulations or OEM routines. For this reason, their performance can considerably decrease in particularly crucial safetycritical situations, where the environmental conditions (rain, snow, ice), the road singularities (oil stains, puddles, holes), and the tyre thermal and ageing phenomena can deeply affect the adherence potential. The objective of the work is to investigate the possibility of the physical model-based control to take into account the variations in terms of the dynamic behavior of the systems and of the boundary conditions. Different scenarios with specific tyre thermal and wear conditions have been tested on diverse road surfaces validating the designed model predictive control algorithm in a hardware-in-the-loop real-time environment and demonstrating the augmented reliability of an advanced virtual driver aware of available information concerning the tyre dynamic limits. The multidisciplinary proposal will provide a paradigm shift in the development of strategies and a solid breakthrough towards enhanced development of the driving automatization systems, unleashing the potential of physical modeling to the next level of vehicle control, able to exploit and to take into account the multi-physical tyre variations.},
