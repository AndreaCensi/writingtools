    Pose optimization is what is used in SLAM to optimize the map
    after pose-pose and pose-features correspondences have been established. 
    The variables in this problem are poses living
    on the nodes of a graph, and measurements are relative measurements
    along the graph edges. The
    problem is hard because orientations live on a manifold
    with nontrivial topology, which makes the problem
    nonlinear, nonconvex, and with multiple minima.
    [Luca][luca] and I try to solve the subproblem of orientation estimation. 
    We find a way to convert
    the problem to an unconstrained optimization problem on integers.
    This makes it possible to solve the problem globally 
    and return all likely guesses for the orientation.

  abstract = { We consider the problem of planning motions in observations space, based on learned models of the dynamics that associate to each action a diffeomorphism of the obser- vations domain. For an arbitrary set of diffeomorphisms, this problem must be formulated as a generic search problem. We adapt established algorithms of the graph search family. In this scenario, node expansion is very costly, as each node in the graph is associated to an uncertain diffeomorphism and corresponding predicted observations. We describe several improvements that ameliorate performance: the introduction of better image similarities to use as heuristics; a method to reduce the number of expanded nodes by preliminarily identifying redundant plans; and a method to pre-compute composite actions that make the search efficient in all directions.},

    Using learned diffeomorphism models of the dynamics of cameras and range-finders,

    Nodes/states are (uncertain) images; actions/edges are (uncertain) diffeomorphisms.

  abstract = {As animals move through the world in search of resources, they
  change course in reaction to both external sensory cues and internally-
  generated programs. Elucidating the functional logic of complex search
  algorithms is challenging because the observable actions of the animal cannot
  be unambiguously assigned to externally- or internally-triggered events. We
  present a technique that addresses this challenge by assessing quantitatively
  the contribution of external stimuli and internal processes. We apply this
  technique to the analysis of rapid turns (saccades) of freely flying
  Drosophila melanogaster. We show that a single scalar feature computed from
  the visual stimulus experienced by the animal is sufficient to explain a
  majority (93%) of the turning decisions. We automatically estimate this scalar
  value from the observable trajectory, without any assumption regarding the
  sensory processing. A posteriori, we show that the estimated feature field is
  consistent with previous results measured in other experimental conditions.
  The remaining turning decisions, not explained by this feature of the visual
  input, may be attributed to a combination of deterministic processes based on
  unobservable internal states and purely stochastic behavior. We cannot
  distinguish these contributions using external observations alone, but we are
  able to provide a quantitative bound of their relative importance with respect
  to stimulus-triggered decisions. Our results suggest that comparatively few
  saccades in free-flying conditions are a result of an intrinsic spontaneous
  process, contrary to previous suggestions. We discuss how this technique could
  be generalized for use in other systems and employed as a tool for classifying
  effects into sensory, decision, and motor categories when used to analyze data
  from genetic behavioral screens.},

    What goes on in a fruit fly's head while it flies? 
    In this paper we try to identify the dependence of the decision processes
    on the external stimulus experienced by the fly. Remarkably, we are able to 
    say a great deal about internal sensory processing by just observing the 
    external behavior.
