  abstract = {As animals move through the world in search of resources, they
  change course in reaction to both external sensory cues and internally-
  generated programs. Elucidating the functional logic of complex search
  algorithms is challenging because the observable actions of the animal cannot
  be unambiguously assigned to externally- or internally-triggered events. We
  present a technique that addresses this challenge by assessing quantitatively
  the contribution of external stimuli and internal processes. We apply this
  technique to the analysis of rapid turns (“saccades”) of freely flying
  Drosophila melanogaster. We show that a single scalar feature computed from
  the visual stimulus experienced by the animal is sufficient to explain a
  majority (93%) of the turning decisions. We automatically estimate this scalar
  value from the observable trajectory, without any assumption regarding the
  sensory processing. A posteriori, we show that the estimated feature field is
  consistent with previous results measured in other experimental conditions.
  The remaining turning decisions, not explained by this feature of the visual
  input, may be attributed to a combination of deterministic processes based on
  unobservable internal states and purely stochastic behavior. We cannot
  distinguish these contributions using external observations alone, but we are
  able to provide a quantitative bound of their relative importance with respect
  to stimulus-triggered decisions. Our results suggest that comparatively few
  saccades in free-flying conditions are a result of an intrinsic spontaneous
  process, contrary to previous suggestions. We discuss how this technique could
  be generalized for use in other systems and employed as a tool for classifying
  effects into sensory, decision, and motor categories when used to analyze data
  from genetic behavioral screens.}
