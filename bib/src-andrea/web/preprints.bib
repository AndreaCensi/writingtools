For a bootstrapping agent connected to an unknown body, the "world" is the series of the unknown actuators, the external environment, and the unknown sensors.
One ability that a bootstrapping agent needs is estimating a predictive model of the observations 
as a function of the commands.  This paper considers the sensorimotor dynamics learning problem for a subset of the "set of all robots" called the Simple Vehicles, which are the idealization of mobile robots equipped with one of the three exteroceptive sensors: field-sampler, vision sensor, and range-finder.
