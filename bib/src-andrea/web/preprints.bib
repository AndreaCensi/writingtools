Design problems can be interconnected together to create "co-design problems", which describe possibly recursive co-design constraints among subsystems. },

Uncertainty has two roles: first, it allows to deal with limited knowledge in the models; second, it also can be used to generate consistent relaxations of a problem, as the computation requirements can be lowered should the user accept some uncertainty in the answer. },
