  Could a "brain in a jar" be able to control an unknown robotic body to which it is connected, and use it to achieve useful tasks, without any prior assumptions on the body's sensors and actuators? In this work, the problem of "bootstrapping" is studied in the context of the Vehicles universe, which is an idealization of simple mobile robots, after the work of Braitenberg. The first thread of results consists in analyzing such simple sensorimotor cascades and proposing models of varying complexity that can be learned from data. The second thread regards how to properly formalize the notions of "absence of assumptions", as a particular form of invariance that the bootstrapping agent must satisfy, and proposes some invariance-based design techniques.

known as servoing) of a second-order rigid-body system with six degrees of
freedom: how to choose forces and torques, based on the current view and a
memorized goal image, to steer the pose towards a desired one. Emphasis has been
given to the bio-plausibility of the computation, in the sense that the control
laws could be in principle implemented on the neural substrate of simple
insects. We show that stabilizing laws can be realized by bilinear/quadratic
operations on the visual input. This particular computational structure has
several numerically favorable characteristics (sparse, local, and parallel), and
thus permits an efficient engineering implementation. We show results of the
control law tested on an indoor helicopter platform.},

mature field with demonstrated successes in various domains. While much progress
has been made in the development of computationally efficient and consistent
mapping schemes, it is still murky, at best, on how these maps can be evaluated.
We are motivated by the absence of an accepted standard for quantitatively
measuring the performance of robotic mapping systems against user-defined
requirements. It is our belief that the development of standardized methods for
quantitatively evaluating existing robotic technologies will improve the utility
of mobile robots in already established application areas, such as vacuum
cleaning, robot surveillance, and bomb disposal. This approach will also enable
the proliferation and acceptance of such technologies in emerging markets. This
chapter summarizes our preliminary efforts by bringing together the research
community towards addressing this important problem which has ramifications not
only from researchers' perspective but also from consumers', robot
manufacturers', and developers' viewpoints.},

  tracking can be bounded by a function of the FIM for
  localization on a known map, thereby reducing the analysis
  to a finite-dimensional problem. The resulting bounds are
  independent of the map prior and representation. The
  results are valid for any relative sensor; the experimental
  verification is done for the particular case of pose

        Modeling robot motion planning with uncertainty in a

        justify a separate implementation of control, localization
        and planning. In the end, we reduce the stochastic control
        problem to path-planning in the extended space of poses x
        covariances; the transitions between states are modeled
        through the use of the Fisher information matrix. In this

        an upper bound on the execution time. Two correct and

        minimizing such metric. The resulting algorithm has some

        We present a new algorithm for solving the global localization
        problem called Frozen-Time Smoother (FTS). Time is `frozen', in
        the sense that the belief always refers to the same time instant,
        instead of following a moving target, like Monte Carlo
        Localization does. This algorithm works in the case in which
        global localization is formulated as a smoothing problem, and a
        precise estimate of the incremental motion of the robot is
        usually available. These assumptions correspond to the case when
        global localization is used to solve the loop closing problem in
        SLAM. We compare FTS to two Monte Carlo methods designed with the
        same assumptions. The experiments suggest that a naive
        implementation of the FTS is more efficient than an extremely
        optimized equivalent Monte Carlo solution. Moreover, the FTS has
        an intrinsic laziness: it does not need frequent updates (scans
        can be integrated once every many meters) and it can process data
        in arbitrary order. The source code and datasets are available
        for download.

        For a differential-drive mobile robot equipped with an
        on-board range sensor, there are six parameters to
        calibrate: three for the odometry (radii and distance
        between the wheels), and three for the pose of the sensor
        with respect to the robot frame. This paper describes a
        method for calibrating all six parameters at the same time,
        without the need for external sensors or devices. Moreover,
        it is not necessary to drive the robot along particular
        trajectories. The available data are the measures of the
        angular velocities of the wheels and the range sensor
        readings. The maximum-likelihood calibration solution is
        found in a closed form.

 Existing methods for estimating the covariance of the ICP 
 (Iterative Closest/Corresponding Point) algorithm are either 
 inaccurate or are computationally too expensive to be used online. 
 This paper proposes a new method, based on the analysis of the error
 function being minimized. It considers that the correspondences are 
 not independent (the same measurement being used in more than one correspondence),
 and explicitly utilizes the covariance matrix of the measurements, 
 which are not assumed to be independent either. The validity of the
 approach is verified through extensive simulations: it is more accurate 
than previous methods and its computational load is negligible. 
The ill-posedness of the surface matching problem is explicitly tackled 
for under-constrained situations by performing an observability analysis; 
in the analyzed cases the method still provides a good estimate of the
 error projected on the observable manifold.

    The covariance of every unbiased estimator is bounded by the Cramer-Rao
    lower bound, which is the inverse of Fisher's information matrix.
    This paper shows that, for the case of localization with range-finders,
    Fisher's matrix is a function of the expected readings and of the
    orientation of the environment's surfaces at the sensed points. The
    matrix also offers a mathematically sound way to characterize under-
    constrained situations as those for which it is singular: in those
    cases the kernel describes the direction of maximum uncertainty.
    This paper also introduces a simple model of unstructured environments
    for which the Cramer-Rao bound is a function of two statistics of
    the shape of the environment: the average radius and a measure of
    the irregularity of the surfaces. Although this model is not valid
    for all environments, it allows for some interesting qualitative
    considerations. As an experimental validation, this paper reports
    simulations comparing the bound with the actual performance of the
    ICP (Iterative Closest/Corresponding Point) algorithm. Finally, it
    is discussed the difficulty in extending these results to find a
    lower bound for accuracy in scan matching and SLAM.},
