  Abstract                 = {At the current state of the art, the agility of an autonomous flying robot is limited by the speed of its sensing pipeline, as the relatively high latency and low sampling frequency limit the aggressiveness of the control strategies that can be implemented. To obtain more agile robots, we need faster sensors. A Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) encodes changes in the perceived brightness using an address-event representation. The latency of such sensors can be measured in the microseconds, thus offering the theoretical possibility of creating a sensing pipeline whose latency is negligible compared to the dynamics of the platform. However, to use these sensors we must rethink the way we interpret visual data. We present an approach to low-latency pose tracking using a DVS and Active Led Markers (ALMs), which are LEDs blinking at high frequency (>1 KHz). The DVS time resolution is able to distinguish different frequencies, thus avoiding the need for data association. We compare the DVS approach to traditional tracking using a CMOS camera, and we show that the DVS performance is not affected by fast motion, unlike the CMOS camera, which suffers from motion blur.},

  Abstract                 = {Diffeomorphisms dynamical systems are dynamical systems where the state is an image and each commands induce a diffeomorphism of the state. These systems can approximate the dynamics of robotic sensorimotor cascades well enough to be used for problems such as planning in observations space. Learning of an arbitrary diffeomorphism from pairs of images is a high dimensional learning problem. This paper describes two improvements to the methods presented in previous work. The previous method had required O(ρ⁴) memory as a function of the desired resolution ρ, which, in practice, was the main limitation to the resolution of the diffeomorphisms that could be learned. This paper describes an algorithm based on recursive refinement that lowers the memory requirement to O(ρ²) memory and O(ρ² log(ρ)) computation. Another improvement regards the estimation the diffeomorphism uncertainty, which is used to represent the sensor's limited field of view; the improved method obtains a more accurate estimation of the uncertainty by checking the consistency of a learned diffeomorphism and its independently learned inverse. The methods are tested on two robotic systems (a pan-tilt camera and a 5-DOF manipulator). },

 Pose optimization is what is used in SLAM to optimize the map
 after pose-pose and pose-features correspondences have been established.
 The variables in this problem are poses living
 on the nodes of a graph, and measurements are relative measurements
 along the graph edges. The
 problem is hard because orientations live on a manifold
 with nontrivial topology, which makes the problem
 nonlinear, nonconvex, and with multiple minima.
 [Luca][luca] and I try to solve the subproblem of orientation estimation.
 We find a way to convert
 the problem to an unconstrained optimization problem on integers.
 This makes it possible to solve the problem globally
 and return all likely guesses for the orientation.

  Abstract                 = {As animals move through the world in search of resources, they
 change course in reaction to both external sensory cues and internally-
 generated programs. Elucidating the functional logic of complex search
 algorithms is challenging because the observable actions of the animal cannot
 be unambiguously assigned to externally- or internally-triggered events. We
 present a technique that addresses this challenge by assessing quantitatively
 the contribution of external stimuli and internal processes. We apply this
 technique to the analysis of rapid turns (saccades) of freely flying
 Drosophila melanogaster. We show that a single scalar feature computed from
 the visual stimulus experienced by the animal is sufficient to explain a
 majority (93%) of the turning decisions. We automatically estimate this scalar
 value from the observable trajectory, without any assumption regarding the
 sensory processing. A posteriori, we show that the estimated feature field is
 consistent with previous results measured in other experimental conditions.
 The remaining turning decisions, not explained by this feature of the visual
 input, may be attributed to a combination of deterministic processes based on
 unobservable internal states and purely stochastic behavior. We cannot
 distinguish these contributions using external observations alone, but we are
 able to provide a quantitative bound of their relative importance with respect
 to stimulus-triggered decisions. Our results suggest that comparatively few
 saccades in free-flying conditions are a result of an intrinsic spontaneous
 process, contrary to previous suggestions. We discuss how this technique could
 be generalized for use in other systems and employed as a tool for classifying
 effects into sensory, decision, and motor categories when used to analyze data
 from genetic behavioral screens.},

 What goes on in a fruit fly's head while it flies?

 external behavior.

In this scenario, node expansion is very costly, as each node in the graph is associated to an uncertain diffeomorphism and corresponding predicted observations.

 Could a "brain in a vat" be able to control an unknown robotic body
 to which it is connected, and use it to achieve useful tasks, without
 any prior assumptions on the body's sensors and actuators? In this
 work, the problem of "bootstrapping" is studied in the context of
 the Vehicles universe, which is an idealization of simple mobile
 robots, after the work of Braitenberg. The first thread of results
 consists in analyzing such simple sensorimotor cascades and proposing
 models of varying complexity that can be learned from data. The second
 thread regards how to properly formalize the notions of "absence
 of assumptions", as a particular form of invariance that the bootstrapping
 agent must satisfy, and proposes some invariance-based design techniques.

 This paper considers the problem of linear filtering over unreliable
 channels. Previous research by Sinopoli et al. has shown that there
 is a threshold on the observations arrival probability that distinguishes
 between a "stable" and an "unstable" behavior. This paper shows that
 those conclusions are misleading and only depend on a particular
 choice of the loss function. In fact, the probability distribution
 of the filter state exists for each nonzero arrival probability.

 and unknown. This paper shows that the FIM for pose tracking can
 be bounded by a function of the FIM for localization on a known map,
 thereby reducing the analysis to a finite-dimensional problem. The
 resulting bounds are independent of the map prior and representation.
 The results are valid for any relative sensor; the experimental verification
 is done for the particular case of pose tracking using range-finders
 (scan matching). },

 steps. The method is validated against vanilla ICP, IDC (Iterative
 Dual Correspondences), and MbICP (Metric-Based ICP) by reproducing
 the experiments performed in Minguez et al. (2006). The experiments
 suggest that PLICP is more precise, and requires less iterations.
 However, it is less robust to very large initial displacement errors.

 of the correspondence search; this allows for significant speed-up
 of the computation. The source code is available for download. },

 a new method, based on the analysis of the error function being minimized.
 It considers that the correspondences are not independent (the same
 measurement being used in more than one correspondence), and explicitly
 utilizes the covariance matrix of the measurements, which are not
 assumed to be independent either. The validity of the approach is
 verified through extensive simulations: it is more accurate than
 previous methods and its computational load is negligible. The ill-posedness
 of the surface matching problem is explicitly tackled for under-constrained
 situations by performing an observability analysis; in the analyzed
 cases the method still provides a good estimate of the error projected
 on the observable manifold.},

 lower bound, which is the inverse of Fisher's information matrix.
 This paper shows that, for the case of localization with range-finders,
 Fisher's matrix is a function of the expected readings and of the
 orientation of the environment's surfaces at the sensed points. The
 matrix also offers a mathematically sound way to characterize under-
 constrained situations as those for which it is singular: in those
 cases the kernel describes the direction of maximum uncertainty.
 This paper also introduces a simple model of unstructured environments
 for which the Cramer-Rao bound is a function of two statistics of
 the shape of the environment: the average radius and a measure of
 the irregularity of the surfaces. Although this model is not valid
 for all environments, it allows for some interesting qualitative
 considerations. As an experimental validation, this paper reports
 simulations comparing the bound with the actual performance of the
 ICP (Iterative Closest/Corresponding Point) algorithm. Finally, it
 is discussed the difficulty in extending these results to find a
 lower bound for accuracy in scan matching and SLAM.},

  Abstract                 = { Modeling robot motion planning with uncertainty in a Bayesian framework
 leads to a computationally intractable stochastic control problem.
 We seek hypotheses that can justify a separate implementation of
 control, localization and planning. In the end, we reduce the stochastic
 control problem to path-planning in the extended space of poses x
 covariances; the transitions between states are modeled through the
 use of the Fisher information matrix. In this framework, we consider
 two problems: minimizing the execution time, and minimizing the final
 covariance, with an upper bound on the execution time. Two correct
 and complete algorithms are presented. The first is the direct extension
 of classical graph-search algorithms in the extended space. The second
 one is a back-projection algorithm: uncertainty constraints are propagated
 backward from the goal towards the start state. },

 sensor, there are six parameters to calibrate: three for the odometry
 (radii and distance between the wheels), and three for the pose of
 the sensor with respect to the robot frame. This paper describes
 a method for calibrating all six parameters at the same time, without
 the need for external sensors or devices. Moreover, it is not necessary
 to drive the robot along particular trajectories. The available data
 are the measures of the angular velocities of the wheels and the
 range sensor readings. The maximum-likelihood calibration solution
 is found in a closed form. },

 the transmission strategy iscompensated by a feedback mechanism which
 can beinterpreted as a self-inhibitory action. The result is thatthe
 average of the nodes state is not conserved acrossiterations, and
 the nodes do not converge to a consensus;however, we show that both
 errors can be made as small asdesired. Bounds on these quantities

 called Frozen-Time Smoother (FTS). Time is `frozen', in the sense
 that the belief always refers to the same time instant, instead of
 following a moving target, like Monte Carlo Localization does. This
 algorithm works in the case in which global localization is formulated
 as a smoothing problem, and a precise estimate of the incremental
 motion of the robot is usually available. These assumptions correspond
 to the case when global localization is used to solve the loop closing
 problem in SLAM. We compare FTS to two Monte Carlo methods designed
 with the same assumptions. The experiments suggest that a naive implementation
 of the FTS is more efficient than an extremely optimized equivalent
 Monte Carlo solution. Moreover, the FTS has an intrinsic laziness:
 it does not need frequent updates (scans can be integrated once every
 many meters) and it can process data in arbitrary order. The source
 code and datasets are available for download. },

 one. Emphasis has been given to the bio-plausibility of the computation,
 in the sense that the control laws could be in principle implemented
 on the neural substrate of simple insects. We show that stabilizing
 laws can be realized by bilinear/quadratic operations on the visual
 input. This particular computational structure has several numerically
 favorable characteristics (sparse, local, and parallel), and thus
 permits an efficient engineering implementation. We show results

  Abstract                 = {Mobile robotic mapping is now considered to be a sufficiently mature
 field with demonstrated successes in various domains. While much
 progress has been made in the development of computationally efficient
 and consistent mapping schemes, it is still murky, at best, on how
 these maps can be evaluated. We are motivated by the absence of an
 accepted standard for quantitatively measuring the performance of
 robotic mapping systems against user-defined requirements. It is
 our belief that the development of standardized methods for quantitatively
 evaluating existing robotic technologies will improve the utility
 of mobile robots in already established application areas, such as
 vacuum cleaning, robot surveillance, and bomb disposal. This approach
 will also enable the proliferation and acceptance of such technologies
 in emerging markets. This chapter summarizes our preliminary efforts
 by bringing together the research community towards addressing this
 important problem which has ramifications not only from researchers'
 perspective but also from consumers', robot manufacturers', and developers'
 viewpoints.},

For a bootstrapping agent connected to an unknown body, the "world" is the series of the unknown actuators, the external environment, and the unknown sensors.
One ability that a bootstrapping agent needs is estimating a predictive model of the observations 
as a function of the commands.  This paper considers the sensorimotor dynamics learning problem for a subset of the "set of all robots" called the Simple Vehicles, which are the idealization of mobile robots equipped with one of the three exteroceptive sensors: field-sampler, vision sensor, and range-finder.
