    Pose optimization is what is used in SLAM to optimize the map
    after pose-pose and pose-features correspondences have been established. 
    The variables in this problem are poses living
    on the nodes of a graph, and measurements are relative measurements
    along the graph edges. The
    problem is hard because orientations live on a manifold
    with nontrivial topology, which makes the problem
    nonlinear, nonconvex, and with multiple minima.
    [Luca][luca] and I try to solve the subproblem of orientation estimation. 
    We find a way to convert
    the problem to an unconstrained optimization problem on integers.
    This makes it possible to solve the problem globally 
    and return all likely guesses for the orientation.

  abstract = {As animals move through the world in search of resources, they
  change course in reaction to both external sensory cues and internally-
  generated programs. Elucidating the functional logic of complex search
  algorithms is challenging because the observable actions of the animal cannot
  be unambiguously assigned to externally- or internally-triggered events. We
  present a technique that addresses this challenge by assessing quantitatively
  the contribution of external stimuli and internal processes. We apply this
  technique to the analysis of rapid turns (saccades) of freely flying
  Drosophila melanogaster. We show that a single scalar feature computed from
  the visual stimulus experienced by the animal is sufficient to explain a
  majority (93%) of the turning decisions. We automatically estimate this scalar
  value from the observable trajectory, without any assumption regarding the
  sensory processing. A posteriori, we show that the estimated feature field is
  consistent with previous results measured in other experimental conditions.
  The remaining turning decisions, not explained by this feature of the visual
  input, may be attributed to a combination of deterministic processes based on
  unobservable internal states and purely stochastic behavior. We cannot
  distinguish these contributions using external observations alone, but we are
  able to provide a quantitative bound of their relative importance with respect
  to stimulus-triggered decisions. Our results suggest that comparatively few
  saccades in free-flying conditions are a result of an intrinsic spontaneous
  process, contrary to previous suggestions. We discuss how this technique could
  be generalized for use in other systems and employed as a tool for classifying
  effects into sensory, decision, and motor categories when used to analyze data
  from genetic behavioral screens.},

In this scenario, node expansion is very costly, as each node in the graph is associated to an uncertain diffeomorphism and corresponding predicted observations. We describe several improvements that ameliorate performance: the introduction of better image similarities to use as heuristics; a method to reduce the number of expanded nodes by preliminarily identifying redundant plans; and a method to pre-compute composite actions that make the search efficient in all directions.},

  Could a "brain in a vat" be able to control an unknown robotic body
  to which it is connected, and use it to achieve useful tasks, without
  any prior assumptions on the body's sensors and actuators? In this
  work, the problem of "bootstrapping" is studied in the context of
  the Vehicles universe, which is an idealization of simple mobile
  robots, after the work of Braitenberg. The first thread of results
  consists in analyzing such simple sensorimotor cascades and proposing
  models of varying complexity that can be learned from data. The second
  thread regards how to properly formalize the notions of "absence
  of assumptions", as a particular form of invariance that the bootstrapping
  agent must satisfy, and proposes some invariance-based design techniques.

  a method for calibrating all six parameters at the same time, without
  the need for external sensors or devices. Moreover, it is not necessary

  algorithm works in the case in which global localization is formulated
  as a smoothing problem, and a precise estimate of the incremental
  motion of the robot is usually available. These assumptions correspond
  to the case when global localization is used to solve the loop closing
  problem in SLAM. We compare FTS to two Monte Carlo methods designed
  with the same assumptions. The experiments suggest that a naive implementation
  of the FTS is more efficient than an extremely optimized equivalent
  Monte Carlo solution. Moreover, the FTS has an intrinsic laziness:
  it does not need frequent updates (scans can be integrated once every
  many meters) and it can process data in arbitrary order. The source

  field with demonstrated successes in various domains. While much
  progress has been made in the development of computationally efficient

  accepted standard for quantitatively measuring the performance of
  robotic mapping systems against user-defined requirements. It is
  our belief that the development of standardized methods for quantitatively
  evaluating existing robotic technologies will improve the utility
  of mobile robots in already established application areas, such as
  vacuum cleaning, robot surveillance, and bomb disposal. This approach
  will also enable the proliferation and acceptance of such technologies
  in emerging markets. This chapter summarizes our preliminary efforts
