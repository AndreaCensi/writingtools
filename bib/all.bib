  abstract = {{Physical human--robot interaction and cooperation has become a topic
	of increasing importance and of major focus in robotics research.
	An essential requirement of a robot designed for high mobility and
	direct interaction with human users or uncertain environments is
	that it must in no case pose a threat to the human. Until recently,
	quite a few attempts were made to investigate real-world threats
	via collision tests and use the outcome to considerably improve safety
	during physical human--robot interaction. In this paper, we give
	an overview of our systematic evaluation of safety in human--robot
	interaction, covering various aspects of the most significant injury
	mechanisms. In order to quantify the potential injury risk emanating
	from such a manipulator, impact tests with the DLR-Lightweight Robot
	III were carried out using standard automobile crash test facilities
	at the German Automobile Club (ADAC). Based on these tests, several
	industrial robots of different weight have been evaluated and the
	influence of the robot mass and velocity have been investigated.
	The evaluated non-constrained impacts would only partially capture
	the nature of human--robot safety. A possibly constrained environment
	and its effect on the resulting human injuries are discussed and
	evaluated from different perspectives. As well as such impact tests
	and simulations, we have analyzed the problem of the quasi-static
	constrained impact, which could pose a serious threat to the human
	even for low-inertia robots under certain circumstances. Finally,
	possible injuries relevant in robotics are summarized and systematically
	classified. 10.1177/0278364909343970}},

  pages = {53-69},
  abstract = {We consider the task of 3-d depth estimation from a single still image.
	We take a supervised learning approach to this problem, in which
	we begin by collecting a training set of monocular images (of unstructured
	indoor and outdoor environments which include forests, sidewalks,
	trees, buildings, etc.) and their corresponding ground-truth depthmaps.
	Then, we apply supervised learning to predict the value of the depthmap
	as a function of the image. Depth estimation is a challenging problem,
	since local features alone are insufficient to estimate depth at
	a point, and one needs to consider the global context of the image.
	Our model uses a hierarchical, multiscale Markov Random Field (MRF)
	that incorporates multiscale local- and global-image features, and
	models the depths and the relation between depths at different points
	in the image. We show that, even on unstructured scenes, our algorithm
	is frequently able to recover fairly accurate depthmaps. We further
	propose a model that incorporates both monocular cues and stereo
	(triangulation) cues, to obtain significantly more accurate depth
	estimates than is possible using either monocular or stereo cues
	alone.},

	distortion, that uses a single image of a planar chessboard pattern
	acquired in general position. The radial distortion is modeled using
	the first order division model, and the method provides a closed
	form estimation of the intrinsic parameters and distortion coefficient.
	The experimental evaluation shows that the calibration accuracy is
	comparable to state-of-the-art algorithms requiring multiple input
	images. We believe that our approach is particularly well suited
	for the the calibration of medical endoscopes in computer aided surgery.
	Since the lens is mounted on the camera before each usage in the
	OR, the calibration procedure must be performed by the clinical practitioner
	with minimum effort. We solve this problem by proposing a fully automatic
	procedure that requires no human intervention other than acquiring
	a single calibration image.}},

  abstract = {A fundamental problem in computer vision is that of inferring the
	intrinsic, 3D structure of the world from flat, 2D images of that
	world. Traditional methods for recovering scene properties such as
	shape, reflectance, or illumination rely on multiple observations
	of the same scene to overconstrain the problem. Recovering these
	same properties from a single image seems almost impossible in comparison
	--- there are an infinite number of shapes, paint, and lights that
	exactly reproduce a single image. However, certain explanations are
	more likely than others: surfaces tend to be smooth, paint tends
	to be uniform, and illumination tends to be natural. We therefore
	pose this problem as one of statistical inference, and define an
	optimization problem that searches for the most likely explanation
	of a single image. Our technique can be viewed as a superset of several
	classic computer vision problems (shape-from-shading, intrinsic images,
	color constancy, illumination estimation, etc) and outperforms all
	previous solutions to those constituent problems.},

  abstract = {{Correction for image distortion in cameras has been an important
	topic for as long as users have wanted to faithfully reproduce or
	use observed information. Initially the main application was mapping.
	While this task continues today, other applications also require
	precise calibration of cameras, such as close range three dimensional
	measurement and many two dimensional measurement tasks. In the past,
	the cameras used were few in number and highly expensive whereas
	today a typical large industrial company will have many inexpensive
	cameras being used for highly important measurement tasks. Cameras
	are used more today than they ever were but the golden age of camera
	calibration for aerial mapping is now well in the past. This paper
	considers some of the key developments and attempts to put them into
	perspective. In particular the driving forces behind each improvement
	have been highlighted.}},
  comment = {Presents a brief history of camera distortion models and correction
	techniques, largely driven by aerial photography for map-making.
	Mentions an initial technique of projecting a captured image back
	through the camera optics to negate distortions. Study in the early
	1900s initially focused on identifying the principal point of the
	image, about which distortion is symmetric, and minimizing average
	radial distortion over the image. More complex characterizations
	began to parametrize radial distortion as a function of radial image
	position, and later to consider tangential distortion. Beginning
	around 1950, field calibration techniques were developed to take
	advantage of the geometry of a known scene. The advent of computers
	allowed the use of least-squares methods to consider many points
	in the image, resulting in greater accuracy across the entire image.
	One group recording ballistic tests used the backdrop of stars as
	a point set with known geometry. Other methods that initially used
	plumb lines to ensure straightness were adapted to use artificial
	structures in the scene such as buildings or railroad tracks. The
	1970's saw the development of self calibration techniques which simultaneously
	yielded lens calibrations and target coordinates. A good self calibration
	requires that the same camera geometry capture at least three images
	of the object from different angles and that many evenly-distributed
	points are used. Much of the later work was enabled by Brown's bundle
	adjustment method, which uses polynomial equations whose coefficients
	may be highly correlated. Iterative procedures have been proposed
	to minimize this error.},

  abstract = {Over the past 50 years, behavioral experiments have produced a large
	body of evidence for the existence of a magnetic sense in a wide
	range of animals. However, the underlying sensory physiology remains
	poorly understood due to the elusiveness of the magnetosensory structures.
	Here we present an effective method for isolating and characterizing
	potential magnetite-based magnetoreceptor cells. In essence, a rotating
	magnetic field is employed to visually identify, within a dissociated
	tissue preparation, cells that contain magnetic material by their
	rotational behavior. As a tissue of choice, we selected trout olfactory
	epithelium that has been previously suggested to host candidate magnetoreceptor
	cells. We were able to reproducibly detect magnetic cells and to
	determine their magnetic dipole moment. The obtained values (4 to
	100fAm2) greatly exceed previous estimates (0.5fAm2). The magnetism
	of the cells is due to a Œºm-sized intracellular structure of iron-rich
	crystals, most likely single-domain magnetite. In confocal reflectance
	imaging, these produce bright reflective spots close to the cell
	membrane. The magnetic inclusions are found to be firmly coupled
	to the cell membrane, enabling a direct transduction of mechanical
	stress produced by magnetic torque acting on the cellular dipole
	in situ. Our results show that the magnetically identified cells
	clearly meet the physical requirements for a magnetoreceptor capable
	of rapidly detecting small changes in the external magnetic field.
	This would also explain interference of ac powerline magnetic fields
	with magnetoreception, as reported in cattle.},

	network. In each discrete time step, a measurement packet is sent
	across a lossy network to an estimator unit consisting of a modified
	Kalman filter. Using the designed estimator algorithm, the importance
	of placing a measurement buffer at the sensor that allows transmission
	of the current and several previous measurements is shown. Previous
	pioneering work on Kalman filtering with intermittent observation
	losses is concerned with the asymptotic behavior of the expected
	value of the error covariance, i.e. as k-->[infinity]. We consider
	a different performance metric, namely a probabilistic statement
	of the error covariance , meaning that with high probability the
	error covariance is bounded above at any instant in time. Provided
	the estimator error covariance has an upper bound whenever a measurement
	packet arrives, we show that for any finite M this statement will
	hold so long as the probability of receiving a measurement packet
	is nonzero. We also give an explicit relationship between M and [epsilon]
	and provide examples to illustrate the theory.},

  abstract = {The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is a widely used model organism
	in studies of genetics, developmental biology and biomechanics. One
	limitation for exploiting Drosophila as a model system for behavioral
	neurobiology is that measuring body kinematics during behavior is
	labor intensive and subjective. In order to quantify flight kinematics
	during different types of maneuvers, we have developed a visual tracking
	system that estimates the posture of the fly from multiple calibrated
	cameras. An accurate geometric fly model is designed using unit quaternions
	to capture complex body and wing rotations, which are automatically
	fitted to the images in each time frame. Our approach works across
	a range of flight behaviors, while also being robust to common environmental
	clutter. The tracking system is used in this paper to compare wing
	and body motion during both voluntary and escape take-offs. Using
	our automated algorithms, we are able to measure stroke amplitude,
	geometric angle of attack and other parameters important to a mechanistic
	understanding of flapping flight. When compared with manual tracking
	methods, the algorithm estimates body position within 4.4{+/-}1.3%
	of the body length, while body orientation is measured within 6.5{+/-}1.9
	deg. (roll), 3.2{+/-}1.3 deg. (pitch) and 3.4{+/-}1.6 deg. (yaw)
	on average across six videos. Similarly, stroke amplitude and deviation
	are estimated within 3.3 deg. and 2.1 deg., while angle of attack
	is typically measured within 8.8 deg. comparing against a human digitizer.
	Using our automated tracker, we analyzed a total of eight voluntary
	and two escape take-offs. These sequences show that Drosophila melanogaster
	do not utilize clap and fling during take-off and are able to modify
	their wing kinematics from one wingstroke to the next. Our approach
	should enable biomechanists and ethologists to process much larger
	datasets than possible at present and, therefore, accelerate insight
	into the mechanisms of free-flight maneuvers of flying insects.},

	- these matching methods are used in many fields involving data analysis
	at research level Contains new algorithms Presents a unifying ANOVA
	framework Procrustean methods are used to transform one set of data
	to represent another set of data as closely as possible. The name
	derives from the Greek myth where Procrustes invited passers-by in
	for a pleasant meal and a night's rest on a magical bed that would
	exactly fit any guest. He then either stretched the guest on the
	rack or cut off their legs to make them fit perfectly into the bed.
	Theseus turned the tables on Procrustes, fatally adjusting him to
	fit his own bed. This text, the first monograph on Procrustes methods,
	unifies several strands in the literature and contains much new material.
	It focuses on matching two or more configurations by using orthogonal,
	projection and oblique axes transformations. Group-average summaries
	play an important part and links with other group-average methods
	are discussed. This is the latest in the well-established and authoritative
	Oxford Statistical Science Series, which includes texts and monographs
	covering many topics of current research interest in pure and applied
	statistics. Each title has an original slant even if the material
	included is not specifically original. The authors are leading researchers
	and the topics covered will be of interest to all professional statisticians,
	whether they be in industry, government department or research institute.

	does not operate as a simple feedback loop. Reafferent and exafferent
	motion stimuli are processed differently. Under open-loop conditions
	responses to motion are weaker than under closed-loop conditions.
	It takes the fly less than 100 ms to distinguish reafferent from
	exafferent motion. In closed-loop conditions, flies constantly generate
	torque fluctuations leading to small-angle oscillations of the panorama.
	This reafferent motion stimulus facilitates the response to exafferent
	motion but does not itself elicit optomotor responses. Reafference
	control appears to be directionally selective: while a displacement
	of the patternm by as little as 0.1° against the ‘expected’ direction
	leads to a fast syndirectional torque response, displacements in
	the ‘expected’ direction have no comparable effect. Based on the
	behavior of the mutantrol sol, which under open-loop conditions is
	directionally motion-blind but in closed-loop conditions still performs
	optomotor balance, a model is proposed in which the fly's endogenous
	torque fluctuations are an essential part of the course control process.
	It is argued that the model may also account for wild type optomotor
	balance in the flight simulator.},

	nets that have many hidden layers. Using complementary priors, we

	networks one layer at a time, provided the top two layers form an
	undirected associative memory. The fast, greedy algorithm is used
	to initialize a slower learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights
	using a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning,
	a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model
	of the joint distribution of handwritten digit images and their labels.
	This generative model gives better digit classification than the
	best discriminative learning algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds
	on which the digits lie are modeled by long ravines in the free-energy
	landscape of the top-level associative memory, and it is easy to
	explore these ravines by using the directed connections to display
	what the associative memory has in mind.},

  abstract = {This book presents sequential decision theory from a novel algorithmic
	information theory perspective. While the former theory is suited
	for active agents in known environments, the latter is suited for
	passive prediction of unknown environments. The book introduces these
	two well-known but very different ideas and removes the limitations
	by unifying them to one parameter-free theory of an optimal reinforcement
	learning agent interacting with an arbitrary unknown world. Most
	if not all AI problems can easily be formulated within this theory,
	which reduces the conceptual problems to pure computational ones.
	Considered problem classes include sequence prediction, strategic
	games, function minimization, reinforcement and supervised learning.
	Formal definitions of intelligence order relations, the horizon problem
	and relations to other approaches to AI are discussed. One intention
	of this book is to excite a broader AI audience about abstract algorithmic
	information theory concepts, and conversely to inform theorists about
	exciting applications to AI.},

  abstract = {{This book presents a unified treatment of linear and nonlinear filtering
	theory for engineers, with sufficient emphasis on applications to
	enable the reader to use the theory. The need for this book is twofold.
	First, although linear estimation theory is relatively well known,
	it is largely scattered in the journal literature and has not been
	collected in a single source. Second, available literature on the
	continuous nonlinear theory is quite esoteric and controversial,
	and thus inaccessible to engineers uninitiated in measure theory
	and stochastic differential equations. Furthermore, it is not clear
	from the available literature whether the nonlinear theory can be
	applied to practical engineering problems. In attempting to fill
	the stated needs, the author has retained as much mathematical rigor
	as he felt was consistent with the prime objective\^{a}\&\#128;\&\#148;to
	explain the theory to engineers. Thus, the author has avoided measure
	theory in this book by using mean square convergence, on the premise
	that everyone knows how to average. As a result, the author only
	requires of the reader background in advanced calculus, theory of
	ordinary differential equations, and matrix analysis.}},

  abstract = {To be autonomous, intelligent robots must learn the foundations of
	commonsense knowledge from their own sensorimotor experience in the
	world. We describe four recent research results that contribute to
	a theory of how a robot learning agent can bootstrap from the blooming
	buzzing confusion of the pixel level to a higher-level ontology including
	distinctive states, places, objects, and actions. This is not a single
	learning problem, but a lattice of related learning tasks, each providing
	prerequisites for tasks to come later. Starting with completely uninterpreted
	sense and motor vectors, as well as an unknown environment, we show
	how a learning agent can separate the sense vector into modalities,
	learn the structure of individual modalities, learn natural primitives
	for the motor system, identify reliable relations between primitive
	actions and created sensory features, and can define useful control
	laws for homing and path-following. Building on this framework, we
	show how an agent can use to self-organizing maps to identify useful
	sensory featurs in the environment, and can learn effective hill-climbing
	control laws to define distinctive states in terms of thos features,
	and trajectoryfollowing control laws to move from one distinctive
	state to another. Moving on to place recognition, we show how an
	agent can combine unsupervised learning, map-learning, and supervised
	learning to achieve high-performance recognition of places from rich
	sensory input. And finally, we take the first steps toward learning
	an ontology of objects, showing tha a bootstrap learning robot can
	learn to individuate objects through motion, separating them from
	the static environment and from each other, and learning properties
	that will be useful for classification. These are four key steps
	in a much larger research enterprise that lays the foundation for
	human and robot commonsense knowledge.},

	the optimal segmentation according to the following hypothesis: Diffusion
	tensors exhibit a Gaussian distribution in the different partitions.
	Moreover, we must respect the geometric constraints imposed by the
	interfaces existing among the cerebral structures and detected by
	the gradient of the diffusion tensor image. We validate our algorithm
	on synthetic data and report interesting results on real datasets.
	We focus on two structures of the white matter with different properties
	and respectively known as the corpus callosum and the corticospinal

	and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. These oscillations are prominent
	in the local field potential, and they also reflect the subthreshold
	membrane potential and strongly modulate the spiking of hippocampal
	neurons. The prevailing view is that theta oscillations are synchronized
	throughout the hippocampus, despite the lack of conclusive experimental
	evidence. In contrast, here we show that in freely behaving rats,
	theta oscillations in area CA1 are travelling waves that propagate
	roughly along the septotemporal axis of the hippocampus. Furthermore,
	we find that spiking in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer is modulated
	in a consistent travelling wave pattern. Our results demonstrate
	that theta oscillations pattern hippocampal activity not only in
	time, but also across anatomical space. The presence of travelling
	waves indicates that the instantaneous output of the hippocampus
	is topographically organized and represents a segment, rather than
	a point, of physical space.},

	to find the optimal camera for 3D motion estimation by analyzing
	the structure of the space formed by the light rays passing through
	a volume of space. Every camera corresponds to a sampling pattern
	in light ray space, thus the question of camera design can be rephrased
	as finding the optimal sampling pattern with regard to a given task.
	This framework suggests that large field-of-view multi-perspective
	(polydioptric) cameras are the optimal image sensors for 3D motion
	estimation. We conclude by proposing design principles for polydioptric
	cameras and describe an algorithm for such a camera that estimates
	its 3D motion in a scene independent and robust manner.},

	systems. Exploiting the framework of Gaussian regression, the unknown
	nonlinear system is seen as a realization from a Gaussian random

	predictor and consists of a mixture of Gaussian kernels parametrized
	by few hyperparameters describing the interactions among past inputs
	and outputs. The kernel structure and the unknown hyperparameters
	are estimated maximizing their marginal likelihood so that the user
	is not required to define any part of the algorithmic architecture,
	e.g., the regressors and the model order. Once the kernel is estimated,
	the nonlinear model is obtained solving a Tikhonov-type variational
	problem. The Hilbert space the estimator belongs to is characterized.
	Benchmarks problems taken from the literature show the effectiveness
	of the new approach, also comparing its performance with a recently
	proposed algorithm based on direct weight optimization and with parametric
	approaches with model order estimated by AIC or BIC.},

  abstract = {Crame´r-Rao bounds on estimation accuracy are established for estimation
	problems on arbitrary manifolds in which no set of intrinsic coordinates
	exists. The frequently encountered examples of estimating either
	an unknown subspace or a covariance matrix are examined in detail.
	The set of subspaces, called the Grassmann manifold, and the set
	of covariance (positive-definite Hermitian) matrices have no fixed
	coordinate system associated with them and do not possess a vector
	space structure, both of which are required for deriving classical
	Crame´r-Rao bounds. Intrinsic versions of the Crame´r-Rao bound on
	manifolds utilizing an arbitrary affine connection with arbitrary
	geodesics are derived for both biased and unbiased estimators. In
	the example of covariance matrix estimation, closed-form expressions
	for both the intrinsic and flat bounds are derived and compared with
	the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the sample covariance matrix
	(SCM) estimator for varying sample support K. The accuracy bound
	on unbiased covariance matrix estimators is shown to be about (10/log
	10)n/K12/ dB, where n is the matrix order. Remarkably, it is shown
	that from an intrinsic perspective, the SCM is a biased and inefficient
	estimator and that the bias term reveals the dependency of estimation
	accuracy on sample support observed in theory and practice. The RMSE
	of the standard method of estimating subspaces using the singular
	value decomposition (SVD) is compared with the intrinsic subspace
	Crame´r-Rao bound derived in closed form by varying both the signal-to-noise
	ratio (SNR) of the unknown p-dimensional subspace and the sample
	support. In the simplest case, the Crame´r-Rao bound on subspace
	estimation accuracy is shown to be about (p(n-p))12-1/2/SNR-12/ rad
	for p-dimensional subspaces. It is seen that the SVD-based method
	yields accuracies very close to the Crame´r-Rao bound, establishing
	that the principal invariant subspace of a random sample provides
	an excellent estimator of an unknown subspace. The analysis approach
	developed is directly applicable to many other estimation problems
	on manifolds encountered in signal processing and elsewhere, such
	as estimating rotation matrices in computer vision a- nd estimating
	subspace basis vectors in blind source separation.},

  title = {An information integration theory of consciousness},
  journal = {BMC Neuroscience},
  year = {2004},
  volume = {5},
  pages = {42},
  number = {1},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND:Consciousness poses two main problems. The first is understanding
	the conditions that determine to what extent a system has conscious
	experience. For instance, why is our consciousness generated by certain
	parts of our brain, such as the thalamocortical system, and not by
	other parts, such as the cerebellum? And why are we conscious during
	wakefulness and much less so during dreamless sleep? The second problem
	is understanding the conditions that determine what kind of consciousness
	a system has. For example, why do specific parts of the brain contribute
	specific qualities to our conscious experience, such as vision and
	audition?PRESENTATION OF THE HYPOTHESIS:This paper presents a theory
	about what consciousness is and how it can be measured. According
	to the theory, consciousness corresponds to the capacity of a system
	to integrate information. This claim is motivated by two key phenomenological
	properties of consciousness: differentiation - the availability of
	a very large number of conscious experiences; and integration - the
	unity of each such experience. The theory states that the quantity
	of consciousness available to a system can be measured as the Phi
	value of a complex of elements. Phi is the amount of causally effective
	information that can be integrated across the informational weakest
	link of a subset of elements. A complex is a subset of elements with
	Phi>0 that is not part of a subset of higher Phi. The theory also
	claims that the quality of consciousness is determined by the informational
	relationships among the elements of a complex, which are specified
	by the values of effective information among them. Finally, each
	particular conscious experience is specified by the value, at any
	given time, of the variables mediating informational interactions
	among the elements of a complex.TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS:The information
	integration theory accounts, in a principled manner, for several
	neurobiological observations concerning consciousness. As shown here,
	these include the association of consciousness with certain neural
	systems rather than with others; the fact that neural processes underlying
	consciousness can influence or be influenced by neural processes
	that remain unconscious; the reduction of consciousness during dreamless
	sleep and generalized seizures; and the time requirements on neural
	interactions that support consciousness.IMPLICATIONS OF THE HYPOTHESIS:The
	theory entails that consciousness is a fundamental quantity, that
	it is graded, that it is present in infants and animals, and that
	it should be possible to build conscious artifacts.},

  abstract = {As animals move through the world in search of resources, they
  change course in reaction to both external sensory cues and internally-
  generated programs. Elucidating the functional logic of complex search
  algorithms is challenging because the observable actions of the animal cannot
  be unambiguously assigned to externally- or internally-triggered events. We
  present a technique that addresses this challenge by assessing quantitatively
  the contribution of external stimuli and internal processes. We apply this
  technique to the analysis of rapid turns (saccades) of freely flying
  Drosophila melanogaster. We show that a single scalar feature computed from
  the visual stimulus experienced by the animal is sufficient to explain a
  majority (93%) of the turning decisions. We automatically estimate this scalar
  value from the observable trajectory, without any assumption regarding the
  sensory processing. A posteriori, we show that the estimated feature field is
  consistent with previous results measured in other experimental conditions.
  The remaining turning decisions, not explained by this feature of the visual
  input, may be attributed to a combination of deterministic processes based on
  unobservable internal states and purely stochastic behavior. We cannot
  distinguish these contributions using external observations alone, but we are
  able to provide a quantitative bound of their relative importance with respect
  to stimulus-triggered decisions. Our results suggest that comparatively few
  saccades in free-flying conditions are a result of an intrinsic spontaneous
  process, contrary to previous suggestions. We discuss how this technique could
  be generalized for use in other systems and employed as a tool for classifying
  effects into sensory, decision, and motor categories when used to analyze data
  from genetic behavioral screens.},
  desc = { 
    What goes on in a fruit fly's head while it flies? 
    In this paper we try to identify the dependence of the decision processes
    on the external stimulus experienced by the fly. Remarkably, we are able to 
    say a great deal about internal sensory processing by just observing the 
    external behavior.

For an arbitrary set of diffeomorphisms, this problem must be formulated as a generic search problem. We adapt established algorithms of the graph search family. In this scenario, node expansion is very costly, as each node in the graph is associated to an uncertain diffeomorphism and corresponding predicted observations. We describe several improvements that ameliorate performance: the introduction of better image similarities to use as heuristics; a method to reduce the number of expanded nodes by preliminarily identifying redundant plans; and a method to pre-compute composite actions that make the search efficient in all directions.},

  Could a "brain in a jar" be able to control an unknown robotic body
  to which it is connected, and use it to achieve useful tasks, without
  any prior assumptions on the body's sensors and actuators? In this
  work, the problem of "bootstrapping" is studied in the context of
  the Vehicles universe, which is an idealization of simple mobile
  robots, after the work of Braitenberg. The first thread of results
  consists in analyzing such simple sensorimotor cascades and proposing
  models of varying complexity that can be learned from data. The second
  thread regards how to properly formalize the notions of "absence
  of assumptions", as a particular form of invariance that the bootstrapping
  agent must satisfy, and proposes some invariance-based design techniques.

  be bounded by a function of the FIM for localization on a known map,

  resulting bounds are independent of the map prior and representation.

  the irregularity of the surfaces. Although this model is not valid

  abstract = {Mobile robotic mapping is now considered to be a sufficiently mature
  field with demonstrated successes in various domains. While much
  progress has been made in the development of computationally efficient
  and consistent mapping schemes, it is still murky, at best, on how
  these maps can be evaluated. We are motivated by the absence of an
  accepted standard for quantitatively measuring the performance of
  robotic mapping systems against user-defined requirements. It is
  our belief that the development of standardized methods for quantitatively
  evaluating existing robotic technologies will improve the utility
  of mobile robots in already established application areas, such as
  vacuum cleaning, robot surveillance, and bomb disposal. This approach
  will also enable the proliferation and acceptance of such technologies
  in emerging markets. This chapter summarizes our preliminary efforts
  by bringing together the research community towards addressing this
  important problem which has ramifications not only from researchers'
  perspective but also from consumers', robot manufacturers', and developers'
  viewpoints.},

  abstract = {Learning and adaptivity will play a large role in robotics in the future, as robots transition from unstructured to unstructured environments that cannot be fully predicted or understood by the designer. Two questions that are open are how much it is possible to learn, and how much we should learn. The goal of bootstrapping is creating agents that are able to learn "everything" from scratch, including a torque-to-pixels models for its robotic body. Systems with such capabilities will be advantaged in terms of being resilient to unforeseen changes and deviations from prior assumptions. The robotics domain is a challenging one for learning, due to the presence of high-dimensional signals, various nonlinearities, and hidden states. There are no formal results, in the spirit of control theory, that could give guarantees. This paper considers the bootstrapping problem for a subset of the set of all robots. The Vehicles, inspired by Braitenberg's work, are idealization of mobile robots equipped with a set of ‚Äúcanonical‚Äù exteroceptive sensors (camera; range-finder; field-sampler). Their sensel-level dynamics are derived and shown to be surprising close. We define the class of BDS models, which assume an instantaneous bilinear dynamics between observations and commands, and derive streaming-based bilinear strategies for them. We show in what sense the BDS dynamics approximates the set of Vehicles to guarantee success in the task of generalized servoing: driving the observations to a given goal snapshot.  Simulations and experiments substantiate the theoretical results. This is the first instance of a bootstrapping agent that can learn the dynamics of a relatively large universe of systems, and use the models to solve well-defined tasks, with no parameter tuning or hand-designed features.},

  abstract = {At the current state of the art, the agility of an autonomous flying robot is limited by the speed of its sensing pipeline, as the relatively high latency and low sampling frequency limit the aggressiveness of the control strategies that can be implemented. To obtain more agile robots, we need faster sensors. A Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) encodes changes in the perceived brightness using an address-event representation. The latency of such sensors can be measured in the microseconds, thus offering the theoretical possibility of creating a sensing pipeline whose latency is negligible compared to the dynamics of the platform. However, to use these sensors we must rethink the way we interpret visual data. We present an approach to low-latency pose tracking using a DVS and Active Led Markers (ALMs), which are LEDs blinking at high frequency (>1 KHz). The DVS time resolution is able to distinguish different frequencies, thus avoiding the need for data association. We compare the DVS approach to traditional tracking using a CMOS camera, and we show that the DVS performance is not affected by fast motion, unlike the CMOS camera, which suffers from motion blur.},

  abstract = {Diffeomorphisms dynamical systems are dynamical systems where the state is an image and each commands induce a diffeomorphism of the state. These systems can approximate the dynamics of robotic sensorimotor cascades well enough to be used for problems such as planning in observations space. Learning of an arbitrary diffeomorphism from pairs of images is a high dimensional learning problem. This paper describes two improvements to the methods presented in previous work. The previous method had required O(œÅ‚Å¥)  memory as a function of the desired resolution œÅ, which, in practice, was the main limitation to the resolution of the diffeomorphisms that could be learned. This paper describes an algorithm based on recursive refinement that lowers the memory requirement to  O(œÅ¬≤) memory and O(œÅ¬≤ log(œÅ)) computation. Another improvement regards the estimation the diffeomorphism uncertainty, which is used to represent the sensor's limited field of view; the improved method obtains a more accurate estimation of the uncertainty by checking the consistency of a learned diffeomorphism and its independently learned inverse. The methods are tested on two robotic systems (a pan-tilt camera and a 5-DOF manipulator). },

    Pose optimization is what is used in SLAM to optimize the map
    after pose-pose and pose-features correspondences have been established. 
    The variables in this problem are poses living
    on the nodes of a graph, and measurements are relative measurements
    along the graph edges. The
    problem is hard because orientations live on a manifold
    with nontrivial topology, which makes the problem
    nonlinear, nonconvex, and with multiple minima.
    [Luca][luca] and I try to solve the subproblem of orientation estimation. 
    We find a way to convert
    the problem to an unconstrained optimization problem on integers.
    This makes it possible to solve the problem globally 
    and return all likely guesses for the orientation.

  abstract = {As animals move through the world in search of resources, they
  change course in reaction to both external sensory cues and internally-
  generated programs. Elucidating the functional logic of complex search
  algorithms is challenging because the observable actions of the animal cannot
  be unambiguously assigned to externally- or internally-triggered events. We
  present a technique that addresses this challenge by assessing quantitatively
  the contribution of external stimuli and internal processes. We apply this
  technique to the analysis of rapid turns (saccades) of freely flying
  Drosophila melanogaster. We show that a single scalar feature computed from
  the visual stimulus experienced by the animal is sufficient to explain a
  majority (93%) of the turning decisions. We automatically estimate this scalar
  value from the observable trajectory, without any assumption regarding the
  sensory processing. A posteriori, we show that the estimated feature field is
  consistent with previous results measured in other experimental conditions.
  The remaining turning decisions, not explained by this feature of the visual
  input, may be attributed to a combination of deterministic processes based on
  unobservable internal states and purely stochastic behavior. We cannot
  distinguish these contributions using external observations alone, but we are
  able to provide a quantitative bound of their relative importance with respect
  to stimulus-triggered decisions. Our results suggest that comparatively few
  saccades in free-flying conditions are a result of an intrinsic spontaneous
  process, contrary to previous suggestions. We discuss how this technique could
  be generalized for use in other systems and employed as a tool for classifying
  effects into sensory, decision, and motor categories when used to analyze data
  from genetic behavioral screens.},
