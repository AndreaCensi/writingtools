  abstract = {Cognitive developmental robotics (CDR) aims to provide new understanding
	of how human's higher cognitive functions develop by means of a synthetic
	approach that developmentally constructs cognitive functions. The
	core idea of CDR is ldquophysical embodimentrdquo that enables information
	structuring through interactions with the environment, including
	other agents. The idea is shaped based on the hypothesized development
	model of human cognitive functions from body representation to social
	behavior. Along with the model, studies of CDR and related works
	are introduced, and discussion on the model and future issues are
	argued.},
