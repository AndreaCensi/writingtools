 core idea of CDR is ldquophysical embodimentrdquo that enables information
 structuring through interactions with the environment, including
 other agents. The idea is shaped based on the hypothesized development
 model of human cognitive functions from body representation to social
 behavior. Along with the model, studies of CDR and related works
 are introduced, and discussion on the model and future issues are
 argued.},

  Abstract                 = {{Physical human--robot interaction and cooperation has become a topic
 of increasing importance and of major focus in robotics research.
 An essential requirement of a robot designed for high mobility and
 direct interaction with human users or uncertain environments is
 that it must in no case pose a threat to the human. Until recently,
 quite a few attempts were made to investigate real-world threats
 via collision tests and use the outcome to considerably improve safety
 during physical human--robot interaction. In this paper, we give
 an overview of our systematic evaluation of safety in human--robot
 interaction, covering various aspects of the most significant injury
 mechanisms. In order to quantify the potential injury risk emanating
 from such a manipulator, impact tests with the DLR-Lightweight Robot
 III were carried out using standard automobile crash test facilities
 at the German Automobile Club (ADAC). Based on these tests, several
 industrial robots of different weight have been evaluated and the
 influence of the robot mass and velocity have been investigated.
 The evaluated non-constrained impacts would only partially capture
 the nature of human--robot safety. A possibly constrained environment
 and its effect on the resulting human injuries are discussed and
 evaluated from different perspectives. As well as such impact tests
 and simulations, we have analyzed the problem of the quasi-static
 constrained impact, which could pose a serious threat to the human
 even for low-inertia robots under certain circumstances. Finally,
 possible injuries relevant in robotics are summarized and systematically
 classified. 10.1177/0278364909343970}},

  Abstract                 = {We consider the task of 3-d depth estimation from a single still image.
 We take a supervised learning approach to this problem, in which
 we begin by collecting a training set of monocular images (of unstructured
 indoor and outdoor environments which include forests, sidewalks,
 trees, buildings, etc.) and their corresponding ground-truth depthmaps.
 Then, we apply supervised learning to predict the value of the depthmap
 as a function of the image. Depth estimation is a challenging problem,
 since local features alone are insufficient to estimate depth at
 a point, and one needs to consider the global context of the image.
 Our model uses a hierarchical, multiscale Markov Random Field (MRF)
 that incorporates multiscale local- and global-image features, and
 models the depths and the relation between depths at different points
 in the image. We show that, even on unstructured scenes, our algorithm
 is frequently able to recover fairly accurate depthmaps. We further
 propose a model that incorporates both monocular cues and stereo
 (triangulation) cues, to obtain significantly more accurate depth
 estimates than is possible using either monocular or stereo cues
 alone.},

A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm<BR>2. A robot must obey orders givein to it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.<BR>3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.</blockquote><P>With these three, simple directives, Isaac Asimov changed our perception of robots forever when he formulated the laws governing their behavior. In <I>I, Robot,</I> Asimov chronicles the development of the robot through a series of interlinked stories: from its primitive origins in the present to its ultimate perfection in the not-so-distant future—a future in which humanity itself may be rendered obsolete.</P><P>Here are stories of robots gone mad, of mind-read robots, and robots with a sense of humor.

  Abstract                 = {{The paper proposes a new calibration algorithm for cameras with lens distortion, that uses a single image of a planar chessboard pattern acquired in general position. The radial distortion is modeled using the first order division model, and the method provides a closed form estimation of the intrinsic parameters and distortion coefficient. The experimental evaluation shows that the calibration accuracy is comparable to state-of-the-art algorithms requiring multiple input images. We believe that our approach is particularly well suited for the the calibration of medical endoscopes in computer aided surgery. Since the lens is mounted on the camera before each usage in the OR, the calibration procedure must be performed by the clinical practitioner with minimum effort. We solve this problem by proposing a fully automatic procedure that requires no human intervention other than acquiring a single calibration image.}},

  Abstract                 = {A fundamental problem in computer vision is that of inferring the intrinsic, 3D structure of the world from flat, 2D images of that world. Traditional methods for recovering scene properties such as shape, reflectance, or illumination rely on multiple observations of the same scene to overconstrain the problem. Recovering these same properties from a single image seems almost impossible in comparison --- there are an infinite number of shapes, paint, and lights that exactly reproduce a single image. However, certain explanations are more likely than others: surfaces tend to be smooth, paint tends to be uniform, and illumination tends to be natural. We therefore pose this problem as one of statistical inference, and define an optimization problem that searches for the most likely explanation of a single image. Our technique can be viewed as a superset of several classic computer vision problems (shape-from-shading, intrinsic images, color constancy, illumination estimation, etc) and outperforms all previous solutions to those constituent problems.},

Biological retinas, and their artificial counterparts, are totally asynchronous and data-driven and rely on a paradigm of light acquisition radically different from most of the currently used frame-grabber technologies. This paper introduces a framework to estimate visual flow from the local properties of events' spatiotemporal space. We will show that precise visual flow orientation and amplitude can be estimated using a local differential approach on the surface defined by coactive events. Experimental results are presented; they show the method adequacy with high data sparseness and temporal resolution of event-based acquisition that allows the computation of motion flow with microsecond accuracy and at very low computational cost.},

Although such robustness would be desirable in engineered systems, most machines fail in the face of unexpected damage. We describe a robot that can recover from such change autonomously, through continuous self-modeling. A four-legged machine uses actuation-sensation relationships to indirectly infer its own structure, and it then uses this self-model to generate forward locomotion. When a leg part is removed, it adapts the self-models, leading to the generation of alternative gaits. This concept may help develop more robust machines and shed light on self-modeling in animals. 10.1126/science.1133687}},

  Abstract                 = {These imaginative thought experiments are the inventions of one of the world's eminent brain researchers. They are "vehicles," a series of hypothetical, self-operating machines that exhibit increasingly intricate if not always successful or civilized "behavior." Each of the vehicles in the series incorporates the essential features of all the earlier models and along the way they come to embody aggression, love, logic, manifestations of foresight, concept formation, creative thinking, personality, and free will. In a section of extensive biological notes, Braitenberg locates many elements of his fantasy in current brain research.<br /> <br /> Valentino Braitenberg is a director of the Max Planck Institute of Biological Cybernetics and Honorary Professor of Information Science at the University of T\"{u}bingen, West Germany.

  Abstract                 = {{Correction for image distortion in cameras has been an important topic for as long as users have wanted to faithfully reproduce or use observed information. Initially the main application was mapping. While this task continues today, other applications also require precise calibration of cameras, such as close range three dimensional measurement and many two dimensional measurement tasks. In the past, the cameras used were few in number and highly expensive whereas today a typical large industrial company will have many inexpensive cameras being used for highly important measurement tasks. Cameras are used more today than they ever were but the golden age of camera calibration for aerial mapping is now well in the past. This paper considers some of the key developments and attempts to put them into perspective. In particular the driving forces behind each improvement have been highlighted.}},
  Comment                  = {Presents a brief history of camera distortion models and correction techniques, largely driven by aerial photography for map-making. Mentions an initial technique of projecting a captured image back through the camera optics to negate distortions. Study in the early 1900s initially focused on identifying the principal point of the image, about which distortion is symmetric, and minimizing average radial distortion over the image. More complex characterizations began to parametrize radial distortion as a function of radial image position, and later to consider tangential distortion. Beginning around 1950, field calibration techniques were developed to take advantage of the geometry of a known scene. The advent of computers allowed the use of least-squares methods to consider many points in the image, resulting in greater accuracy across the entire image. One group recording ballistic tests used the backdrop of stars as a point set with known geometry. Other methods that initially used plumb lines to ensure straightness were adapted to use artificial structures in the scene such as buildings or railroad tracks. The 1970's saw the development of self calibration techniques which simultaneously yielded lens calibrations and target coordinates. A good self calibration requires that the same camera geometry capture at least three images of the object from different angles and that many evenly-distributed points are used. Much of the later work was enabled by Brown's bundle adjustment method, which uses polynomial equations whose coefficients may be highly correlated. Iterative procedures have been proposed to minimize this error.},

Instead of using geometric features (points, straight lines, pose, homography, etc.) as it is usually done, we use directly the luminance of all pixels in the image. Since most of the classical control laws fail in this case, we turn the visual servoing problem into an optimization problem leading to a new control law. Experimental results validate the proposed approach and show its robustness regarding to approximated depths, non Lambertian objects and partial occlusions.}},

  Abstract                 = {Over the past 50 years, behavioral experiments have produced a large body of evidence for the existence of a magnetic sense in a wide range of animals. However, the underlying sensory physiology remains poorly understood due to the elusiveness of the magnetosensory structures. Here we present an effective method for isolating and characterizing potential magnetite-based magnetoreceptor cells. In essence, a rotating magnetic field is employed to visually identify, within a dissociated tissue preparation, cells that contain magnetic material by their rotational behavior. As a tissue of choice, we selected trout olfactory epithelium that has been previously suggested to host candidate magnetoreceptor cells. We were able to reproducibly detect magnetic cells and to determine their magnetic dipole moment. The obtained values (4 to 100fAm2) greatly exceed previous estimates (0.5fAm2). The magnetism of the cells is due to a Œºm-sized intracellular structure of iron-rich crystals, most likely single-domain magnetite. In confocal reflectance imaging, these produce bright reflective spots close to the cell membrane. The magnetic inclusions are found to be firmly coupled to the cell membrane, enabling a direct transduction of mechanical stress produced by magnetic torque acting on the cellular dipole in situ. Our results show that the magnetically identified cells clearly meet the physical requirements for a magnetoreceptor capable of rapidly detecting small changes in the external magnetic field. This would also explain interference of ac powerline magnetic fields with magnetoreception, as reported in cattle.},

  Abstract                 = {We consider a discrete time state estimation problem over a packet-based network. In each discrete time step, a measurement packet is sent across a lossy network to an estimator unit consisting of a modified Kalman filter. Using the designed estimator algorithm, the importance of placing a measurement buffer at the sensor that allows transmission of the current and several previous measurements is shown. Previous pioneering work on Kalman filtering with intermittent observation losses is concerned with the asymptotic behavior of the expected value of the error covariance, i.e. as k-->[infinity]. We consider a different performance metric, namely a probabilistic statement of the error covariance , meaning that with high probability the error covariance is bounded above at any instant in time. Provided the estimator error covariance has an upper bound whenever a measurement packet arrives, we show that for any finite M this statement will hold so long as the probability of receiving a measurement packet is nonzero. We also give an explicit relationship between M and [epsilon] and provide examples to illustrate the theory.},

  Abstract                 = {The authors generalize linear subspace identification theory to an analog theory for the subspace identification of bilinear systems. A major assumption they make is that the inputs of the system should be white and mutually independent. It is shown that in that case most of the properties of linear subspace identification theory can be extended to similar properties for bilinear systems. The link between the presented bilinear subspace method and Kalman filter theory is made. Finally, the practical relevance of the method is illustrated by making a direct comparison between linear and bilinear subspace identification methods when applied on data from a model of a distillation column},

  Abstract                 = {The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is a widely used model organism in studies of genetics, developmental biology and biomechanics. One limitation for exploiting Drosophila as a model system for behavioral neurobiology is that measuring body kinematics during behavior is labor intensive and subjective. In order to quantify flight kinematics during different types of maneuvers, we have developed a visual tracking system that estimates the posture of the fly from multiple calibrated cameras. An accurate geometric fly model is designed using unit quaternions to capture complex body and wing rotations, which are automatically fitted to the images in each time frame. Our approach works across a range of flight behaviors, while also being robust to common environmental clutter. The tracking system is used in this paper to compare wing and body motion during both voluntary and escape take-offs. Using our automated algorithms, we are able to measure stroke amplitude, geometric angle of attack and other parameters important to a mechanistic understanding of flapping flight. When compared with manual tracking methods, the algorithm estimates body position within 4.4{+/-}1.3% of the body length, while body orientation is measured within 6.5{+/-}1.9 deg. (roll), 3.2{+/-}1.3 deg. (pitch) and 3.4{+/-}1.6 deg. (yaw) on average across six videos. Similarly, stroke amplitude and deviation are estimated within 3.3 deg. and 2.1 deg., while angle of attack is typically measured within 8.8 deg. comparing against a human digitizer. Using our automated tracker, we analyzed a total of eight voluntary and two escape take-offs. These sequences show that Drosophila melanogaster do not utilize clap and fling during take-off and are able to modify their wing kinematics from one wingstroke to the next. Our approach should enable biomechanists and ethologists to process much larger datasets than possible at present and, therefore, accelerate insight into the mechanisms of free-flight maneuvers of flying insects.},

  Abstract                 = {First systematic overview of Procrustean methods in one volume Multi-disciplinary - these matching methods are used in many fields involving data analysis at research level Contains new algorithms Presents a unifying ANOVA framework Procrustean methods are used to transform one set of data to represent another set of data as closely as possible. The name derives from the Greek myth where Procrustes invited passers-by in for a pleasant meal and a night's rest on a magical bed that would exactly fit any guest. He then either stretched the guest on the rack or cut off their legs to make them fit perfectly into the bed. Theseus turned the tables on Procrustes, fatally adjusting him to fit his own bed. This text, the first monograph on Procrustes methods, unifies several strands in the literature and contains much new material. It focuses on matching two or more configurations by using orthogonal, projection and oblique axes transformations. Group-average summaries play an important part and links with other group-average methods are discussed. This is the latest in the well-established and authoritative Oxford Statistical Science Series, which includes texts and monographs covering many topics of current research interest in pure and applied statistics. Each title has an original slant even if the material included is not specifically original. The authors are leading researchers and the topics covered will be of interest to all professional statisticians, whether they be in industry, government department or research institute.

  Abstract                 = {In the flight simulator the optomotor response ofDrosophila melanogaster does not operate as a simple feedback loop. Reafferent and exafferent motion stimuli are processed differently. Under open-loop conditions responses to motion are weaker than under closed-loop conditions. It takes the fly less than 100 ms to distinguish reafferent from exafferent motion. In closed-loop conditions, flies constantly generate torque fluctuations leading to small-angle oscillations of the panorama. This reafferent motion stimulus facilitates the response to exafferent motion but does not itself elicit optomotor responses. Reafference control appears to be directionally selective: while a displacement of the patternm by as little as 0.1° against the ‘expected’ direction leads to a fast syndirectional torque response, displacements in the ‘expected’ direction have no comparable effect. Based on the behavior of the mutantrol sol, which under open-loop conditions is directionally motion-blind but in closed-loop conditions still performs optomotor balance, a model is proposed in which the fly's endogenous torque fluctuations are an essential part of the course control process. It is argued that the model may also account for wild type optomotor balance in the flight simulator.},

  Abstract                 = {We show how to use "complementary priors" to eliminate the explaining-away effects that make inference difficult in densely connected belief nets that have many hidden layers. Using complementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy algorithm that can learn deep, directed belief networks one layer at a time, provided the top two layers form an undirected associative memory. The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights using a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution of handwritten digit images and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discriminative learning algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modeled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory, and it is easy to explore these ravines by using the directed connections to display what the associative memory has in mind.},

The eDVS provides a sparse pre-processed visual signature of the currently visible patch of ceiling, which is used for real-time simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Signals from the robot's bump switches together with its current position estimate continuously improve the system's reasoning about traversable areas. A heuristic path planning method motivated by the A* search algorithm generates routes for continuous autonomous exploration. We demonstrate robust real-time operation and evaluate the performance of our system in various indoor environments.},

  Abstract                 = {Computational properties of use of biological organisms or to the construction of computers can emerge as collective properties of systems having a large number of simple equivalent components (or neurons). The physical meaning of content-addressable memory is described by an appropriate phase space flow of the state of a system. A model of such a system is given, based on aspects of neurobiology but readily adapted to integrated circuits. The collective properties of this model produce a content-addressable memory which correctly yields an entire memory from any subpart of sufficient size. The algorithm for the time evolution of the state of the system is based on asynchronous parallel processing. Additional emergent collective properties include some capacity for generalization, familiarity recognition, categorization, error correction, and time sequence retention. The collective properties are only weakly sensitive to details of the modeling or the failure of individual devices.},

  Abstract                 = {This book presents sequential decision theory from a novel algorithmic information theory perspective. While the former theory is suited for active agents in known environments, the latter is suited for passive prediction of unknown environments. The book introduces these two well-known but very different ideas and removes the limitations by unifying them to one parameter-free theory of an optimal reinforcement learning agent interacting with an arbitrary unknown world. Most if not all AI problems can easily be formulated within this theory, which reduces the conceptual problems to pure computational ones. Considered problem classes include sequence prediction, strategic games, function minimization, reinforcement and supervised learning. Formal definitions of intelligence order relations, the horizon problem and relations to other approaches to AI are discussed. One intention of this book is to excite a broader AI audience about abstract algorithmic information theory concepts, and conversely to inform theorists about exciting applications to AI.},

  Abstract                 = {{This book presents a unified treatment of linear and nonlinear filtering theory for engineers, with sufficient emphasis on applications to enable the reader to use the theory. The need for this book is twofold. First, although linear estimation theory is relatively well known, it is largely scattered in the journal literature and has not been collected in a single source. Second, available literature on the continuous nonlinear theory is quite esoteric and controversial, and thus inaccessible to engineers uninitiated in measure theory and stochastic differential equations. Furthermore, it is not clear from the available literature whether the nonlinear theory can be applied to practical engineering problems. In attempting to fill the stated needs, the author has retained as much mathematical rigor as he felt was consistent with the prime objective\^{a}\&\#128;\&\#148;to explain the theory to engineers. Thus, the author has avoided measure theory in this book by using mean square convergence, on the premise that everyone knows how to average. As a result, the author only requires of the reader background in advanced calculus, theory of ordinary differential equations, and matrix analysis.}},

How accurately can information be encoded in the voltage across the membrane, in the intracellular calcium concentration or in the timing of individual spikes? "Biophysics of Computation: Information Processing in Single Neurons" focuses on these questions at the interface between cellular biophysics and computational theory. Neural network research builds on the fiction that neurons are simple linear threshold units, completely neglecting the highly dynamic and complex nature of synapses, dendrites and voltage-dependent ionic currents. This textbook rectifies this situation. <P>Key topics are the linear cable equation, passive dendritic trees and dendritic spines, chemical and electrical synapses and how to treat them from a computational point of view, nonlinear interactions in passive and active dendritic trees, the Hodgkin-Huxley model of action potential generation and propagation, phase space analysis, linking stochastic ionic channels to membrane dependent currents, calcium- and potassium-currents and their role in information processing, the role of diffusion, buffering and binding of calcium and other messenger systems in information processing and storage, short- and long-term models of synaptic plasticity, simplified models of single cells, stochastic aspects of neuronal firing, the nature of the neuronal code and unconventional models of computation involving molecules, puffs of gas or neuropeptides. <P>Each chapter ends with a recapitulation of the material presented. The ultimate chapter provides a summary view of neuron-style computation, ending with a list of strategic questions for research. The text speaks to undergraduate and graduate students and beyond in the neuroscience, electrical and computer engineering and physics communities.}},

For an embedded intelligent system to operate in such a world it must also be able to segment its sensory stream into objects and label those objects appropriately.

  Abstract                 = {To be autonomous, intelligent robots must learn the foundations of commonsense knowledge from their own sensorimotor experience in the world. We describe four recent research results that contribute to a theory of how a robot learning agent can bootstrap from the blooming buzzing confusion of the pixel level to a higher-level ontology including distinctive states, places, objects, and actions. This is not a single learning problem, but a lattice of related learning tasks, each providing prerequisites for tasks to come later. Starting with completely uninterpreted sense and motor vectors, as well as an unknown environment, we show how a learning agent can separate the sense vector into modalities, learn the structure of individual modalities, learn natural primitives for the motor system, identify reliable relations between primitive actions and created sensory features, and can define useful control laws for homing and path-following. Building on this framework, we show how an agent can use to self-organizing maps to identify useful sensory featurs in the environment, and can learn effective hill-climbing control laws to define distinctive states in terms of thos features, and trajectoryfollowing control laws to move from one distinctive state to another. Moving on to place recognition, we show how an agent can combine unsupervised learning, map-learning, and supervised learning to achieve high-performance recognition of places from rich sensory input. And finally, we take the first steps toward learning an ontology of objects, showing tha a bootstrap learning robot can learn to individuate objects through motion, separating them from the static environment and from each other, and learning properties that will be useful for classification. These are four key steps in a much larger research enterprise that lays the foundation for human and robot commonsense knowledge.},

  Abstract                 = {We address the problem of the segmentation of cerebral white matter structures from diffusion tensor images. Our approach is grounded on the theoretically well-founded differential geometrical properties of the space of multivariate normal distributions. We introduce a variational formulation, in the level set framework, to estimate the optimal segmentation according to the following hypothesis: Diffusion tensors exhibit a Gaussian distribution in the different partitions. Moreover, we must respect the geometric constraints imposed by the interfaces existing among the cerebral structures and detected by the gradient of the diffusion tensor image. We validate our algorithm on synthetic data and report interesting results on real datasets. We focus on two structures of the white matter with different properties and respectively known as the corpus callosum and the corticospinal tract.},

  Abstract                 = {Although some algorithms are better than others on average, there is rarely a best algorithm for a given problem. Instead, different algorithms often perform well on different problem instances. Not surprisingly, this phenomenon is most pronounced among algorithms for solving-hard problems, when runtimes are highly variable from instance to instance. When algorithms exhibit high runtime variance, one is faced with the problem of deciding which algorithm to use for each particular instance; in 1976 Rice dubbed this the “algorithm selection problem” [8]. More recent work on this problem includes [5,4].},

  Abstract                 = {Theta oscillations clock hippocampal activity during awake behaviour and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. These oscillations are prominent in the local field potential, and they also reflect the subthreshold membrane potential and strongly modulate the spiking of hippocampal neurons. The prevailing view is that theta oscillations are synchronized throughout the hippocampus, despite the lack of conclusive experimental evidence. In contrast, here we show that in freely behaving rats, theta oscillations in area CA1 are travelling waves that propagate roughly along the septotemporal axis of the hippocampus. Furthermore, we find that spiking in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer is modulated in a consistent travelling wave pattern. Our results demonstrate that theta oscillations pattern hippocampal activity not only in time, but also across anatomical space. The presence of travelling waves indicates that the instantaneous output of the hippocampus is topographically organized and represents a segment, rather than a point, of physical space.},

We evaluate how well this intrinsically acquired object knowledge can be used to solve externally specified tasks, including object recognition and achieving goals that require both planning and continuous control.}},

  Abstract                 = {Most cameras used in computer vision applications are still based on the pinhole principle inspired by our own eyes. It has been found though that this is not necessarily the optimal image formation principle for processing visual information using a machine. We describe how to find the optimal camera for 3D motion estimation by analyzing the structure of the space formed by the light rays passing through a volume of space. Every camera corresponds to a sampling pattern in light ray space, thus the question of camera design can be rephrased as finding the optimal sampling pattern with regard to a given task. This framework suggests that large field-of-view multi-perspective (polydioptric) cameras are the optimal image sensors for 3D motion estimation. We conclude by proposing design principles for polydioptric cameras and describe an algorithm for such a camera that estimates its 3D motion in a scene independent and robust manner.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a novel nonparametric approach for identification of nonlinear systems. Exploiting the framework of Gaussian regression, the unknown nonlinear system is seen as a realization from a Gaussian random field. Its covariance encodes the idea of ``fading'' memory in the predictor and consists of a mixture of Gaussian kernels parametrized by few hyperparameters describing the interactions among past inputs and outputs. The kernel structure and the unknown hyperparameters are estimated maximizing their marginal likelihood so that the user is not required to define any part of the algorithmic architecture, e.g., the regressors and the model order. Once the kernel is estimated, the nonlinear model is obtained solving a Tikhonov-type variational problem. The Hilbert space the estimator belongs to is characterized. Benchmarks problems taken from the literature show the effectiveness of the new approach, also comparing its performance with a recently proposed algorithm based on direct weight optimization and with parametric approaches with model order estimated by AIC or BIC.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a novel event-based stereo matching algorithm that exploits the asynchronous visual events from a pair of silicon retinas. Unlike conventional frame-based cameras, recent artificial retinas transmit their outputs as a continuous stream of asynchronous temporal events, in a manner similar to the output cells of the biological retina. Our algorithm uses the timing information carried by this representation in addressing the stereo-matching problem on moving objects. Using the high temporal resolution of the acquired data stream for the dynamic vision sensor, we show that matching on the timing of the visual events provides a new solution to the real-time computation of 3-D objects when combined with geometric constraints using the distance to the epipolar lines. The proposed algorithm is able to filter out incorrect matches and to accurately reconstruct the depth of moving objects despite the low spatial resolution of the sensor. This brief sets up the principles for further event-based vision processing and demonstrates the importance of dynamic information and spike timing in processing asynchronous streams of visual events.},

  Abstract                 = {Grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) are part of an environment-independent spatial coordinate system. To determine how information about location, direction, and distance is integrated in the grid-cell network, we recorded from each principal cell layer of MEC in rats that explored two-dimensional environments. Whereas layer II was predominated by grid cells, grid cells colocalized with head-direction cells and conjunctive grid x head-direction cells in the deeper layers. All cell types were modulated by running speed. The conjunction of positional, directional, and translational information in a single MEC cell type may enable grid coordinates to be updated during self-motion-based navigation.},

  Abstract                 = {Crame´r-Rao bounds on estimation accuracy are established for estimation problems on arbitrary manifolds in which no set of intrinsic coordinates exists. The frequently encountered examples of estimating either an unknown subspace or a covariance matrix are examined in detail. The set of subspaces, called the Grassmann manifold, and the set of covariance (positive-definite Hermitian) matrices have no fixed coordinate system associated with them and do not possess a vector space structure, both of which are required for deriving classical Crame´r-Rao bounds. Intrinsic versions of the Crame´r-Rao bound on manifolds utilizing an arbitrary affine connection with arbitrary geodesics are derived for both biased and unbiased estimators. In the example of covariance matrix estimation, closed-form expressions for both the intrinsic and flat bounds are derived and compared with the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the sample covariance matrix (SCM) estimator for varying sample support K. The accuracy bound on unbiased covariance matrix estimators is shown to be about (10/log 10)n/K12/ dB, where n is the matrix order. Remarkably, it is shown that from an intrinsic perspective, the SCM is a biased and inefficient estimator and that the bias term reveals the dependency of estimation accuracy on sample support observed in theory and practice. The RMSE of the standard method of estimating subspaces using the singular value decomposition (SVD) is compared with the intrinsic subspace Crame´r-Rao bound derived in closed form by varying both the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the unknown p-dimensional subspace and the sample support. In the simplest case, the Crame´r-Rao bound on subspace estimation accuracy is shown to be about (p(n-p))12-1/2/SNR-12/ rad for p-dimensional subspaces. It is seen that the SVD-based method yields accuracies very close to the Crame´r-Rao bound, establishing that the principal invariant subspace of a random sample provides an excellent estimator of an unknown subspace. The analysis approach developed is directly applicable to many other estimation problems on manifolds encountered in signal processing and elsewhere, such as estimating rotation matrices in computer vision a- nd estimating subspace basis vectors in blind source separation.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:Consciousness poses two main problems. The first is understanding the conditions that determine to what extent a system has conscious experience. For instance, why is our consciousness generated by certain parts of our brain, such as the thalamocortical system, and not by other parts, such as the cerebellum? And why are we conscious during wakefulness and much less so during dreamless sleep? The second problem is understanding the conditions that determine what kind of consciousness a system has. For example, why do specific parts of the brain contribute specific qualities to our conscious experience, such as vision and audition?PRESENTATION OF THE HYPOTHESIS:This paper presents a theory about what consciousness is and how it can be measured. According to the theory, consciousness corresponds to the capacity of a system to integrate information. This claim is motivated by two key phenomenological properties of consciousness: differentiation - the availability of a very large number of conscious experiences; and integration - the unity of each such experience. The theory states that the quantity of consciousness available to a system can be measured as the Phi value of a complex of elements. Phi is the amount of causally effective information that can be integrated across the informational weakest link of a subset of elements. A complex is a subset of elements with Phi>0 that is not part of a subset of higher Phi. The theory also claims that the quality of consciousness is determined by the informational relationships among the elements of a complex, which are specified by the values of effective information among them. Finally, each particular conscious experience is specified by the value, at any given time, of the variables mediating informational interactions among the elements of a complex.TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS:The information integration theory accounts, in a principled manner, for several neurobiological observations concerning consciousness. As shown here, these include the association of consciousness with certain neural systems rather than with others; the fact that neural processes underlying consciousness can influence or be influenced by neural processes that remain unconscious; the reduction of consciousness during dreamless sleep and generalized seizures; and the time requirements on neural interactions that support consciousness.IMPLICATIONS OF THE HYPOTHESIS:The theory entails that consciousness is a fundamental quantity, that it is graded, that it is present in infants and animals, and that it should be possible to build conscious artifacts.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a novel algorithm for robot self-localization using an embedded event-based sensor. This sensor produces a stream of events at microsecond time resolution which only represents pixel-level illumination changes in a scene, as e.g. caused by perceived motion. This is in contrast to classical image sensors, which wastefully transmit redundant information at a much lower frame rate. Our method adapts the commonly used Condensation Particle Filter Tracker to such event-based sensors. It works directly with individual, highly ambiguous pixel-events and does not employ event integration over time. The lack of complete discrete sensory measurements is addressed by applying an exponential decay model for hypotheses likelihood computation. The proposed algorithm demonstrates robust performance at low computation requirements; turning it suitable for implementation in embedded hardware on small autonomous robots. We evaluate our algorithm in a simulation environment and with experimental recorded data.},

  Abstract                 = {We aim at developing autonomous microflyers capable of navigating within houses or small indoor environments using vision as the principal source of information. Due to severe weight and energy constraints, inspiration is taken from the fly for the selection of sensors, for signal processing, and for the control strategy. The current 30-g prototype is capable of autonomous steering in a 16x16m textured environment. This paper describes models and algorithms which allow for efficient course stabilization and collision avoidance using optic flow and inertial information.},

  Abstract                 = {{Synthesis of robots may be decomposed into two processes: {\em structural synthesis} (determine the general arrangement of the mechanical structure such as the type and number of joints and the way they will be connected) and {\em dimensional synthesis} (determine the length of the links, the axis and location of the joints, the necessary maximal joint forces/torques,$\ldots$). The performances that may be obtained for a robot are drastically dependent on both synthesis. Although for serial robots general trends may be derived only from the structure a realistic comparison between two different structures may only be made after a careful dimensional synthesis and this is even more so for closed-loop robot (such as parallel robots). We will present a dimensional synthesis approach based on the design requirements that allows one to obtain almost all feasible design solutions that are guaranteed to satisfy the requirements, even taking into account manufacturing tolerances. Practical examples of 6-DOF robot design will be presented.}},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The paper describes a visual method for the navigation of autonomous floor-cleaning robots. The method constructs a topological map with metrical information where place nodes are characterized by panoramic images and by particle clouds representing position estimates. Current image and position estimate of the robot are interrelated to landmark images and position estimates stored in the map nodes through a holistic visual homing method which provides bearing and orientation estimates. Based on these estimates, a position estimate of the robot is updated by a particle filter. The robot’s position estimates are used to guide the robot along parallel, meandering lanes and are also assigned to newly created map nodes which later serve as landmarks. Computer simulations and robot experiments confirm that the robot position estimate obtained by this method is sufficiently accurate to keep the robot on parallel lanes, even in the presence of large random and systematic odometry errors. This ensures an efficient cleaning behavior with almost complete coverage of a rectangular area and only small repeated coverage. Furthermore, the topological-metrical map can be used to completely cover rooms or apartments by multiple meander parts. },

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, floor-cleaning coverage performances of some domestic mobile robots are measured, analyzed and modeled. Results obtained in a reduced scenario show that floor-cleaning coverage is complete in all cases if the path-planning exploration algorithm has some random dependence. Additionally, the evolution of the area cleaned by the mobile robot expressed in a distance domain has an exponential shape that can be modeled with a single exponential where the amplitude defines the maximum cleaning-coverage achieved and the time-constant defines the dynamic evolution of the coverage. Both parameters are robot dependent and can be estimated if the area of the room is known and then floor-cleaning coverage can be predicted and over-cleaning minimized. },
