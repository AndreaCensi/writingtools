  abstract = {{Physical human--robot interaction and cooperation has become a topic
	of increasing importance and of major focus in robotics research.
	An essential requirement of a robot designed for high mobility and
	direct interaction with human users or uncertain environments is
	that it must in no case pose a threat to the human. Until recently,
	quite a few attempts were made to investigate real-world threats
	via collision tests and use the outcome to considerably improve safety
	during physical human--robot interaction. In this paper, we give
	an overview of our systematic evaluation of safety in human--robot
	interaction, covering various aspects of the most significant injury
	mechanisms. In order to quantify the potential injury risk emanating
	from such a manipulator, impact tests with the DLR-Lightweight Robot
	III were carried out using standard automobile crash test facilities
	at the German Automobile Club (ADAC). Based on these tests, several
	industrial robots of different weight have been evaluated and the
	influence of the robot mass and velocity have been investigated.
	The evaluated non-constrained impacts would only partially capture
	the nature of human--robot safety. A possibly constrained environment
	and its effect on the resulting human injuries are discussed and
	evaluated from different perspectives. As well as such impact tests
	and simulations, we have analyzed the problem of the quasi-static
	constrained impact, which could pose a serious threat to the human
	even for low-inertia robots under certain circumstances. Finally,
	possible injuries relevant in robotics are summarized and systematically
	classified. 10.1177/0278364909343970}},
