  title = {3-D Depth Reconstruction from a Single Still Image},
  journal = {International Journal of Computer Vision},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {76},
  pages = {53-69},
  abstract = {We consider the task of 3-d depth estimation from a single still image.
	We take a supervised learning approach to this problem, in which
	we begin by collecting a training set of monocular images (of unstructured
	indoor and outdoor environments which include forests, sidewalks,
	trees, buildings, etc.) and their corresponding ground-truth depthmaps.
	Then, we apply supervised learning to predict the value of the depthmap
	as a function of the image. Depth estimation is a challenging problem,
	since local features alone are insufficient to estimate depth at
	a point, and one needs to consider the global context of the image.
	Our model uses a hierarchical, multiscale Markov Random Field (MRF)
	that incorporates multiscale local- and global-image features, and
	models the depths and the relation between depths at different points
	in the image. We show that, even on unstructured scenes, our algorithm
	is frequently able to recover fairly accurate depthmaps. We further
	propose a model that incorporates both monocular cues and stereo
	(triangulation) cues, to obtain significantly more accurate depth
	estimates than is possible using either monocular or stereo cues
	alone.},
